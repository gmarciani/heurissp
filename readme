# ABSTRACT
SSP is a command-line based application that allows the user to 
solve the Subset-Sum Problem (SSP) with some heuristic algorithms.

# UPDATES
GMParser updates available at https://github.com/gmarciani/ssp


# EXECUTION
Simply run the .jar with neither arguments nor options to access the 
SSP main view.

	(java -jar) ssp.jar

A handy menu-based navigation will guide the user in the use of the app.


# SSP RESOLUTION
A SSP resolution is a complete fairness report about the specified sets and capacity.

	(java -jar) ssp.jar -s SET_A SET_B CAPACITY


# PARETO-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS
The following Pareto-optimal determinations are available:
 - All Combinations (CMB)
 - Optimized Combinations (CMBO)

	(java -jar) ssp.jar -p SET_A SET_B CAPACITY 


# FAIRNESS ANALYSIS
The following fairness analysis methods are available:
 - Max-Min Fairness (MM)
 - Kalai-Smorodinski Fairness (KS)
 - Proportional Fairness (PR)
 
Applying all fairness methods:

	(java -jar) ssp.jar -f PARETO_SOLUTIONS

Or applying a specific fairness method:

	(java -jar) ssp.jar -f --mm PARETO_SOLUTIONS
	(java -jar) ssp.jar -f --ks PARETO_SOLUTIONS MAX_A MAX_B
	(java -jar) ssp.jar -f --pr PARETO_SOLUTIONS


# DOCUMENTATION
The code is fully documented. 

Particular attention has been given to the documentation on the most critical 
and interesting portions of code. 
To facilitate the code navigability, had been inserted bookmarks in correspondence 
with the aforesaid portions (available by the Eclipse 'Bookmarks' view).

JavaDocs available at http://gmarciani.com/project/ssp/javadoc/index.html

# TEST
The tests were run on a 2 GHz Intel i5 with 2GB of RAM, running Linux Ubuntu 14.04 
and Java 1.8.

Every JUnit-based test suite is available in package ssp.test.

Tests output related to faireness session, both on Max-Min, Kalai-Smorodinski and 
Proportional are available in folder /test.
